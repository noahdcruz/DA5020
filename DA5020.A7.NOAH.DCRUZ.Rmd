# Fully explain the income inequality and how to solve it (Not an economist btw)

# The World Bank and OWID rates are close shows a high level of poverty compared to first table data

#Germany shows virtually no poverty at the given limits of 2,3 and 6
#However, the World Bank and OWID rates are slightly higher possibly reflecting a more defined (I guess) national poverty line.


#Mexico's poverty rates increase significantly with each limti
#which show a wide distribution of income levels (growing population and developing ecomony?)
#There a difference between the World Bank and OWID rates with OWID reporting a higher rate

#Morocco shows a modest increase across the limits
#but the national rates reported by the World Bank and OWID are significantly lower. (Different meaurements?)

#Vietnam's rates are low at the $2.15 limit and rise with higher klimts. 
#The World Bank and OWID rates differ, with OWID being a higher poverty rate

#This basically shows that poverty has different measurements 
#Also there is the factor that Countries who are industraizaling faster and younger populations will have
# more poverty and income inequality, CONTTRAST this to germanty who is inudtrialized alread
# and has office jobs and shrinking population
