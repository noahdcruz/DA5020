## Graph shows total domestic passengers in March from 2006 to 2021
## Can see upwards trend from 2006 to 2019, maybe this could be due to spring
## break as spring break is always in March and people do travel for the break
## There is drop in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19, quarantines,
## lockdown and travel restrictions. Not covid or flight expert btw

## Forecast for total passenger activity in March 19 using a simple moving average

## was 6,899,726 passengers. Difference is 128,119
## Since, the simple moving averaage forecast was lower than the actual figure, maybe the
## method did not capture external or random trends in data leading up to 2019.
## That can not be seen in the data of 2016,2017 and 2018. Not a flying expert btw

## Weighted moving average forecast for total passengers activtiy in March 2019

# Q5

## The exponential smoothing forecast for total passenger activity in March 2019
## was 6,991,737 passengers using an alpha of 0.7
## This probably due to the model giving a high weight to more recent data.
## Actual recorded passenger activity was 6,899,726 passengers. The forcast
## error is -92,010.74 passengers, overestimating the actual count. 
## Maybe there are external factors that are not being tracked or monitored that
## is why the actual domestic passengers did not grow by that amount

# Q6

## The linear regeression model shows a prediction of 7,293,811 total passengers for March 2019

## While the actual 2019 was 6,899,726 and the actual 2020 was 2,863,074
## March 2019 was an overestmation maybe becasue due to increases from previous
## years and the 2020 figure is off due to the model not seeing Covid-19 and its effects.
